		<h3>The most famous chemists</h3>
		<br>
		<img src="7.jpg" title="Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier  ز Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion. He recognized and named oxygen (1778) and hydrogen (1783), and opposed the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier helped construct the metric system, wrote the first extensive list of elements, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. He predicted the existence of silicon (1787) and was also the first to establish that sulfur was an element (1777) rather than a compound. He discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, its mass always remains the same.Lavoisier was a powerful member of a number of aristocratic councils." height="176" width="200">

		<img src="8.jpg" title="John Dalton ( 6 September 1766 – 27 July 1844) was an English chemist, physicist, and meteorologist. He is best known for introducing the atomic theory into chemistry, and for his research into colour blindness, sometimes referred to as Daltonism in his honour. " height="176" width="200">

		<img src="9.jpg" title="Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro ( 9 August 1776 – 9 July 1856), Count of Quaregna and Cerreto, was an Italian scientist, most noted for his contribution to molecular theory now known as Avogadro's law, which states that equal volumes of gases under the same conditions of temperature and pressure will contain equal numbers of molecules. In tribute to him, the number of elementary entities (atoms, molecules, ions or other particles) in 1 mole of a substance, 6.02214076×1023, is known as the Avogadro constant, one of the seven SI base units and represented by NA." height="176" width="200">
